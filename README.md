# google maps examples

Google maps api is an interesting and fun way to make a great interactive map. Here are a few of the ways it can be implemented.

## WebComponents

I love both vinal js compoents and polymer. However the google maps polymer component is poorly maintained and comes with a lot of un-needed baggage. In the polymer folder I have implemented both with the component to point out its flaws and plugged in the javascript library to the polymer life cycle.

## React

React may be the most popular framework today so I also through in the google maps api to a react app to show a starting point for our react folks.

## Vanilla JS

This is the basic starting point provided in their documentation.
